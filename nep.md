# Noebs Enhancements Proposals (NEP)

This will servce as NEP-0. The goal of NEP is to offer a better way such that other contributors can find and easy to follow process to contribute with features that drastically change how noebs works. This document is intended as a first NEP so that others can follow suit.

## About the NEP

This should be a very brief description about the NEP. It should not exceed a paragraph and it should just focus on high overview about the intended change and how it affects noebs and also mentions the rationale behind it. This is really the main selling point of the NEP. While there are so many reasons to add / remove things from noebs, we can only just accept few of them. It is important for the long term vision of the project to be reasonable about the features we can support and the code we can commit to.

## Detailed description about the NEP

This is where we encourage you to tell your story! In great details, you can use this section to tell us about the change, why it is needed, mention concrete real world use cases, and show some figures and numbers regarding expected change impact, how it relates to other partners and existing users of the platform and so. 

## Demo

One of the most important aspects of accepting any proposal is to see it in real life. A demo, even just for a very small subset of the intended features will go along to support the NEP.

## Tests and documentations

Any NEP won't be accepted without providing sufficient unit testing. Many businesses are trusting noebs with their backend systems and noebs has proven to be a solid platform with more than 3 years of production usage. We want to keep it that way and we want to ensure any new contributions will not degrade the quality of the system. We are not picky at all about the code, it really doesn't matter as long as we format everything with gofmt, and it follows that. Unit testings are the only way for us to ensure the quality of the provided code. Any code that doesn't come with unit testing will be stalled until the contributor amends their pull request with the necessary testing. Documentations on the other hand are super important as it tells us what this feature does and serves as an Specs for the code.
